**Project Title:** *Project on Stroke Prediction*
**Project Description:** The project aims to develop a predictive model for stroke occurrence based on a healthcare dataset containing various patient attributes, such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle factors, and health metrics (e.g., glucose level and BMI). It includes data analysis, exploration, visualization, model training, and evaluation to determine the model's effectiveness. The final predictive system provides insights into stroke risk factors, supporting proactive health management.
